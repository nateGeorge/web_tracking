# web_tracking

## Summary:
Track computers/users with javascript and node.js.

This uses [fingerprintjs2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2).

I was also trying to use [evercookie](https://github.com/samyk/evercookie), but ended up just using
Flash LSOs (https://github.com/faisalman/flash-cookie-js).

## To install:
There are a number of dependencies for nodejs for this.  You can see them in the first few lines of the .js file, soon to be in a config file for installation.

## To run server:
`node track_node_express.js`

Go to localhost:3001, press ctrl+shift+i in Chrome to see console output (dev tools).
